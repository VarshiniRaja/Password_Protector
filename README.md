# Password_Protector
This aims to enhance digital security with a multi-factor authentication system that includes facial recognition, voice authentication, and management of secure passwords via an intelligent voice assistant. It is designed using TensorFlow for facial recognition and Gaussian Mixture Models for voice authentication, making the experience seamless and fully secured for the user. Continuous protection is ensured through real-time anomaly detection, and fall-back mechanisms obviate unauthorized access. This solution aggregates different kinds of biometric modalities, overcoming traditional authentication weaknesses and thus offering both security and user convenience.
